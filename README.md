# Workshop Module 08

This repository is for learners on Corndel's DevOps apprenticeship.

If you attended workshop 7, continue working with your repository from before. If you do not have your own repository from workshop 7 for whatever reason, you will need to create one:
- On GitHub, fork this repository.
- On GitLab, create a new GitLab repository based on this one. See step 1 of [workshop_7_gitlab.md](workshop_7_gitlab.md).

There are valid workflow files included here as a starting point (`.github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml` for GitHub or `.gitlab-ci.yml` for GitLab)

During this workshop follow the instructions in [during_workshop_8.md](./during_workshop_8.md).

Workshop 7's instructions are included to refresh your memory or in case you would like to go back and attempt those stretch goals.
